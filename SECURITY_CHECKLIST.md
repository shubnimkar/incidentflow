# üîí Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

### Environment Variables Cleanup
- [x] Removed all `.env` files from git history
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` to properly ignore `.env` files
- [x] Created `.env.example` files for all services
- [x] Updated README with proper environment setup instructions
- [x] Force pushed clean history to all branches

## üö® Critical Security Actions Required

### 1. Rotate Exposed Secrets
Since `.env` files were in git history, these secrets should be considered compromised:

**Database Credentials:**
- [ ] Rotate MongoDB connection strings
- [ ] Update database passwords

**JWT Secrets:**
- [ ] Generate new JWT_SECRET for all services
- [ ] Invalidate existing tokens (users will need to re-login)

**AWS Credentials:**
- [ ] Rotate AWS Access Keys
- [ ] Update S3 bucket permissions if needed

**OAuth Credentials:**
- [ ] Regenerate Google OAuth client secrets
- [ ] Regenerate GitHub OAuth client secrets
- [ ] Regenerate Microsoft OAuth client secrets

**Email/SMTP:**
- [ ] Rotate SMTP passwords
- [ ] Update email service credentials

**Twilio:**
- [ ] Rotate Twilio auth tokens
- [ ] Update Twilio account SID if needed

### 2. Environment Setup
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` files to `.env` in each service
- [ ] Fill in new, secure credentials
- [ ] Test all services with new credentials

### 3. Team Communication
- [ ] Notify team members about the security incident
- [ ] Instruct team to pull latest changes
- [ ] Share new environment variables securely

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### Git Hooks (Recommended)
Consider adding pre-commit hooks to prevent future commits of sensitive files:

```bash
# Create .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "\.env$"; then
    echo "Error: .env files cannot be committed!"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Regular Security Audits
- [ ] Monthly review of committed files
- [ ] Check for exposed secrets in git history
- [ ] Review access permissions

### Best Practices Going Forward
- [ ] Always use `.env.example` files
- [ ] Never commit actual `.env` files
- [ ] Use secure secret management in production
- [ ] Regular security training for team

## üìã Verification Checklist

After completing the above actions:

- [ ] All services start without errors
- [ ] Authentication works with new JWT secrets
- [ ] File uploads work with new AWS credentials
- [ ] Email functionality works with new SMTP credentials
- [ ] OAuth login works with new client secrets
- [ ] No `.env` files appear in `git status`
- [ ] `.env.example` files are committed and up-to-date

## üÜò Emergency Contacts

If you need immediate assistance:
- AWS Support: For AWS credential rotation
- MongoDB Atlas: For database credential updates
- OAuth Providers: For client secret regeneration
- Email Service Provider: For SMTP credential updates

**Remember:** Security is an ongoing process. Regular audits and updates are essential to maintain a secure codebase.
